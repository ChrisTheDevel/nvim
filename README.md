# My vim config

This is my vim setup that I use for everything text related. It's currently quite crap but I'm working on that...

## Vision

I want to create an environment were I can do everything from making realtime lecture notes in latex, to general development in several languages. I want the configurations for all these things to only be active when needed (should be doable). 

The configs should be able to be used on any unix system without to much setup (at the moment I have to install nvr and such manually. I should be able to automate this with some scripts)

### Realtime notes in latex

I want to create something along the lines of [these blog posts]{https://castel.dev/} but without having to build an entire system around it (meaning I want to keep all the configurations I have to make to my vimsetup).

### Integration with ANKI

The flashcards should be editable with neovim
